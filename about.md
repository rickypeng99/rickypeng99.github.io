## Intro
Hello guys! I am Ruiqi Peng, but I prefer to be called as Ricky. I am currently a sophomore majoring in Math & CS at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign!  
Here is my most recent photo (I took it on the last day of my stay at my freshman dormitory):

PS. I do know that I look nerdy which is why I am editing this website instead of hanging out with girls on May 20th, 2018, the Valentines day of modern China due to the similar pronunciations of "May 20th" and "I love you" in Mandarin.
